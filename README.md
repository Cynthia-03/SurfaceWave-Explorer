Waveform Explorer: Interactive 3D Surface Visualization
Waveform Explorer is an interactive 3D visualization tool that renders mathematical surfaces in real-time using Three.js. The default surface is z = sin(x) + sin(y), but users can customize various parameters to explore different wave patterns and behaviors.

Features
Real-time 3D Rendering: Visualize mathematical surfaces with smooth animations

Interactive Controls:

Drag to rotate the camera

Scroll to zoom in/out

Adjust parameters to modify the surface

Customizable Parameters:

X and Y range (Â±)

X and Y frequency

Mesh resolution

Visualization Modes:

Smooth surface rendering

Wireframe overlay

Animated time-based effects

Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

Live Demo
View the live demo here

Usage
Adjust the parameters in the control panel:

X/Y Range: Controls the visible area in the x and y dimensions

X/Y Frequency: Adjusts the frequency of the sine waves

Resolution: Controls the mesh density

Use the control buttons:

Update: Apply parameter changes

Animate/Pause: Toggle wave animation

Wireframe/Hide Wire: Toggle wireframe overlay

Reset: Restore default parameters

Interact with the visualization:

Click and drag to rotate the camera

Scroll to zoom in/out

Touch and drag on mobile devices

Technical Implementation
This project is built with:

Three.js for 3D rendering

WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics

Modern JavaScript (ES6) features

CSS gradients and effects for the UI

The surface is generated by evaluating the function:

text
z = sin(xFrequency * x + time) + sin(yFrequency * y + time)
at each vertex of a parametric plane mesh.
